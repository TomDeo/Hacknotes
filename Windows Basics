REMOTE ACCESS CONCEPTS
Remote Access is accessing a computer over a network. Local access to a computer is needed before one can access another computer remotely. 
There are countless methods for remote access:

  Some of the most common remote access technologies include but aren't limited to:

    Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
    Secure Shell (SSH)
    File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
    Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
    Windows Remote Management (or PowerShell Remoting) (WinRM)
    Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
    
    
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
RDP uses a client/server architecture where a client-side application is used to specify a computer's target IP address or hostname over a network where RDP access is
enabled, The target computer where RDP remote access is enabled is considered the server. It is important to note that RDP listens by default on logical port 3389. 

We can use RDP to connect to a Windows target from an attack host running Linux or Windows. If we are connecting to a Windows target from a Windows host, we can use the
built-in RDP client application called Remote Desktop Connection (mstsc.exe).
For this to work, remote access must already be allowed on the target Windows system. By default, remote access is not allowed on Windows operating systems.

Remote Desktop Connection also allows us to save connection profiles. This is a common habit among IT admins because it makes connecting to remote systems more 
convenient and as pentesters, we can benefit from looking for these saved Remote Desktop Files (.rdp) while on an engagement.



Using xfreerdp
From a Linux-based attack host we can use a tool called xfreerdp to remotely access Windows targets. 

   xfreerdp /v:<targetIp> /u:user /p:Password

OPERATING SYSTEM STRUCTURE

In Windows operating systems, the root directory is <drive_letter>:\ (commonly C drive). The root directory (also known as the boot partition) is where the operating
system is installed. Other physical and virtual drives are assigned other letters, for example, Data (E:).

DIRECTORY	            FUNCTION
Perflogs  	          Can hold Windows performance logs but is empty by default.
Program Files 	      On 32-bit systems, all 16-bit and 32-bit programs are installed here. On 64-bit systems, only 64-bit programs are installed here.
Program Files (x86) 	32-bit and 16-bit programs are installed here on 64-bit editions of Windows.
ProgramData	          This is a hidden folder that contains data that is essential for certain installed programs to run. 
                      This data is accessible by the program no matter what user is running it.
Users	                This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the system and contains the two folders Public and Default.
Default	              This is the default user profile template for all created users.
                      Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on the Default profile.
Public	              This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the network
                      by default but requires a valid network account to access.
AppData	              Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user subfolder (i.e., cliff.moore\AppData). 
                      Each of these folders contains three subfolders. The Roaming folder contains machine-independent data that should follow the user's profile, 
                      such as custom dictionaries. The Local folder is specific to the computer itself and is never synchronized across the network.
                      LocalLow is similar to the Local folder, but it has a lower data integrity level. Therefore it can be used, for example, by a web browser set to protected or safe mode.
Windows	              The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system are contained here.
System,System32,SysWOW64	Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the Windows API. 
                          The operating system searches these folders any time a program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path.
WinSxS	              The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, updates, and service packs.




EXPLORING DIRECTORIES

We can explore the file system using the dir command.
  dir c:\
   ->Imprime el contenido dentro de "c"

The tree utility is useful for graphically displaying the directory structure of a path or disk.
  tree c:\program files (x86)\vmware
  
we can use the command type to get the content of a file
  type flag.txt

FILE SYSTEM

There are 5 types of Windows file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, and exFAT. FAT12 and FAT16 are no longer used on modern Windows operating systems. 

FAT32 (File Allocation Table) is widely used across many types of storage devices such as USB memory sticks and SD cards but can also be used to format hard drives.
The "32" in the name refers to the fact that FAT32 uses 32 bits of data for identifying data clusters on a storage device.
Pros of FAT32:
Device compatibility - it can be used on computers, digital cameras, gaming consoles, smartphones, tablets, and more.
Operating system cross-compatibility - It works on all Windows operating systems starting from Windows 95 and is also supported by MacOS and Linux.
Cons of FAT32:
Can only be used with files that are less than 4GB.
No built-in data protection or file compression features.
Must use third-party tools for file encryption.

NTFS (New Technology File System) is the default Windows file system since Windows NT 3.1. In addition to making up for the shortcomings of FAT32,
NTFS also has better support for metadata and better performance due to improved data structuring.
Pros of NTFS:
NTFS is reliable and can restore the consistency of the file system in the event of a system failure or power loss.
Provides security by allowing us to set granular permissions on both files and folders.
Supports very large-sized partitions.
Has journaling built-in, meaning that file modifications (addition, modification, deletion) are logged.
Cons of NTFS:
Most mobile devices do not support NTFS natively.
Older media devices such as TVs and digital cameras do not offer support for NTFS storage devices.


Permissions
The NTFS file system has many basic and advanced permissions. Some of the key permission types are:

Permission Type	      Description
Full Control	        Allows reading, writing, changing, deleting of files/folders.
Modify	              Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.
List Folder Contents	Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.
Read and Execute	    Allows for viewing and listing files and subfolders as well as executing files. Files and folders inherit this permission.
Write	                Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing to a file.
Read	                Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and viewing a file's contents.
Traverse Folder	      This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach other files or folders. 
                      For example, a user may not have permission to list the directory contents or view files in the documents or web apps directory in this example
                      c:\users\bsmith\documents\webapps\backups\backup_02042020.zip but with Traverse Folder permissions applied, they can access the backup archive.




Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)
NTFS permissions on files and folders in Windows can be managed using the File Explorer GUI under the security tab. Apart from the GUI, we can also achieve a fine
level of granularity over NTFS file permissions in Windows from the command line using the icacls utility.

We can list out the NTFS permissions on a specific directory by running either icacls from within the working directory or icacls C:\Windows against a directory not
currently in.

The resource access level is list after each user in the output. The possible inheritance settings are:

(CI): container inherit
(OI): object inherit
(IO): inherit only
(NP): do not propagate inherit
(I): permission inherited from parent container
In the above example, the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account has object inherit, container inherit, inherit only, and full access permissions.
This means that this account has full control over all file system objects in this directory and subdirectories.

Basic access permissions are as follows:

F : full access
D :  delete access
N :  no access
M :  modify access
RX :  read and execute access
R :  read-only access
W :  write-only access
